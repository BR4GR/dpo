Yet to this\r\nprimitive source, it is said, may be traced the evolution of the\r\nstringed instrument which reached its culmination in the piano. The\r\nlatter has been aptly called \"the household orchestra,\" and in tracing\r\nits origin one must go far back into the annals of the past. If we\r\naccept the Bible as history, and it is the greatest of all histories,\r\nthe stringed instrument is of very ancient date. It is recorded that the\r\nambassadors who came to the court of Saul played upon their _nebels_,\r\nand that David, the sweet singer of Israel, wooed the king from his\r\nsadness by singing to his harp. We must go back to the civilization of\r\nancient Egypt, more than five hundred years before that morning nearly\r\ntwo thousand years ago when, it is written, the angelic choir chanted\r\nabove the historic manger the glorious message, \"Peace on earth, good\r\nwill to men,\" and the morning stars sang together.\r\n\r\nIn the olden times the Greeks laid claim to everything which bespoke\r\nculture and progress. The pages of ancient history record no other one\r\nthing so persistently as \"the glory that was Greece.\" And so they tell\r\nof the time when--\r\n\r\n    \"Music, heavenly maid, was young,\r\n    And yet in ancient Greece she sung!\"\r\n\r\nIt is now generally conceded, however, that it was not in Greece but in\r\nancient Egypt that art, music, and the sciences in general were born.\r\nThat the Egyptians had stringed instruments is unquestionable. Away back\r\nin the year 525 B.C. Cambyses subdued the land. He overthrew the temples\r\nin the ruins of which have been found the records of musical instruments\r\ndating from the very earliest times. But the priests who guarded the\r\ntemples were slain, and every vestige of what might have helped to\r\ndetermine the origin of the stringed instrument, out of which, later,\r\nthe piano was evolved, as well as the names of those who wrought and\r\nendeavored to construct instruments which would give forth music, was\r\nforever lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clavicytherium or Upright Spinet]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clavichord]\r\n\r\nFor lack of written authority, then, one must turn back to tradition for\r\nlight upon the origin of the piano. Tradition says that Ham, or one of\r\nhis sons, led the first colony into Egypt. In fact there is a legend\r\nthat Noah himself once dwelt there and some historians have identified\r\nhim with the great deity of the Egyptians, Osiris. To Hermes, or\r\nMercury, the secretary of Osiris, is ascribed the invention of the first\r\nstringed instrument. The story is that Hermes was walking one day along\r\nthe banks of the Nile. It was just after one of the great inundations.\r\nThe Nile had overflowed its banks and the land had been submerged.\r\nBut now the water had subsided, and as Hermes walked along the shore,\r\nhis foot struck accidentally against the shell of a dead tortoise.\r\nAcross the inside of the shell the dried sinews were tightly stretched.\r\nHermes picked it up and touched the sinews with his fingers. He was\r\namazed to hear the sweet tones which the picking of the strings\r\nproduced. He set to work to make a musical instrument, using the shell\r\nof a tortoise for the body and placing strings across it. In\r\nsubstantiation of this legend we find in examining the lyre of the\r\nancient Greeks that almost every one was ornamented with a tortoise. We\r\nfind also in the records of the Hindus, the Chinese, the Persians, and\r\nthe Hebrews that these people had stringed musical instruments at a\r\nvery early date and that the most common among them was the lyre in its\r\nvarious modifications.\r\n\r\nThe famous sepulcher of Rameses III is elaborately ornamented with\r\nharps. Specimens of this instrument have been found also in excavations\r\nmade in comparatively recent years. In 1823 Sir J. G. Wilkinson\r\ndiscovered in an old Egyptian tomb a harp which, despite the fact that\r\nthree thousand years had gone by since it had been put to sleep beside\r\nits royal master, was in an excellent state of preservation. The strings\r\nwere of cat-gut and were in marvelously good condition. The custom which\r\nthe Egyptians had of portraying their daily life upon their city walls,\r\ntheir temples, and tombs has been of incalculable value to the\r\nantiquarians in search of authentic information. From the pictures which\r\nornament these temples and tombs we have learned that the harp and the\r\nlyre were the favorite instruments of the Egyptians, and these carvings\r\nalone furnish indisputable proof of their use by these people.\r\n\r\nBut all the research which man, thus far, has been able to make has not\r\nrevealed just who it was that first discovered music in a lifeless\r\ninstrument. This fact will always be deeply veiled in mystery. All\r\nattempts to unravel the threads have failed. None knows yet just who\r\nthey were who first\r\n\r\n    \"Struck the chorded shell,\r\n    And, wondering, on their faces fell\r\n    To worship the celestial sounds.\r\n    Less than a God they thought there scarce could dwell\r\n    Within the hollow of that shell\r\n    That spoke so sweetly and so well.\"\r\n\r\nJust how many strings Hermes had on his tortoise-shell instrument is a\r\nmuch disputed question. Some say there were but three and that they\r\nrepresented the three seasons--spring, summer, and winter--into which it\r\nwas the custom of the Greeks to divide their year. Some authorities\r\nclaim that the strings numbered four. Others say there were seven. No\r\none knows. The Greek harp was played by picking the strings with the\r\nfingers or with a plectrum. The latter was a small piece of bone or\r\nmetal, held in the fingers, with which the strings were snapped.\r\nSometimes a short piece of wood was used to strike the strings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spinet]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Queen Elizabeth's Virginal]\r\n\r\nA step forward in the evolution of the stringed instrument was made\r\nduring the Middle Ages when the psaltery became popular. It consisted of\r\na box with strings across it, and records for us the first attempt at a\r\nsounding board. This was followed by the dulcimer, which closely\r\nresembled it but was somewhat larger. A plectrum was used to play them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nA very good idea of the psaltery and dulcimer may be obtained from the\r\nxylophone. This instrument has bars of wood or metal which are struck\r\nwith a wooden mallet. The keyboard was invented in the eleventh century.\r\nIt was applied first to an instrument called a clavier and later to the\r\norgan. The first stringed instrument to which this new device was\r\napplied was the clavicytherium, or keyed cithara. It had a box with a\r\ncover and strings of cat-gut, arranged in the form of a half triangle.\r\nIt was made to sound by means of a quill plectrum attached in a rude way\r\nto the end of the keys. This was the progress the piano of today had\r\nmade in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nNext in order of development comes the monochord, clarichord, or\r\nclavichord, the latter being the name by which it is generally known. As\r\nit was the instrument most used during the six centuries which followed,\r\nit is worthy of close study. In shape it much resembled a small square\r\npiano without frame or legs. The strings were of brass, struck by a\r\nwedge made of the same metal which was called a tangent. It was capable\r\nof soft tones only, but they were very sweet and melancholy. The elder\r\nBach loved this instrument. He did not take kindly to the piano which\r\nwas about to supplant his beloved clavichord. One regrets that he could\r\nnot have lived to have seen it perfected. In playing the music written\r\nby Bach we must remember that he wrote entirely for the clavichord. The\r\ninstrument he used was, without doubt, the product of Italy, as during\r\nthis time the Italians led all Europe in the arts. At a later period the\r\nclavichord was copied by the Germans and Belgians. It was used by them\r\nfor centuries on account of its simple construction and low price.\r\nMozart always carried one with him as part of his baggage when\r\ntraveling. The virginal, spinet, and harpsichord followed the clavichord\r\nin rapid succession, considering that the last named instrument had been\r\nin favor for such a long time, with seemingly no attempt at improvement.\r\nAll of these three instruments had strings of brass, with quill plectra\r\nattached to pieces of wood. These were called \"jacks\"--a name still used\r\ntoday in making up the action of the piano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Double Spinet or Virginal made by Ludovicus Grovvelus\r\nFlanders, 1600]\r\n\r\nThe virginal and spinet were almost identical with each other, but the\r\nharpsichord was larger and occasionally was built with two keyboards.\r\nThere are several explanations as to why the virginal was so called.\r\nOne is that it got its name from its association with hymns to the\r\nVirgin. Another is that it was thus called in honor of Elizabeth, the\r\nVirgin Queen. We may accept whichever theory best suits us, but history\r\nrecords that both Elizabeth and Mary of Scotland were proficient in its\r\nuse and that it was the favorite instrument of Henry VIII. Items for\r\nrepairs and for instruction in playing the virginal appear frequently in\r\nthe royal expense book, showing conclusively that His Majesty was not\r\nunmindful of such accomplishments. Four octaves was the range of these\r\nold instruments, from the second added line below in the bass to the\r\nsecond added line above in the treble. There was but one string to each\r\nnote, and one can well understand why a writer of that period describes\r\nthe tone as \"a _scratch_ with a _sound_ at the end of it.\" Queen\r\nElizabeth's virginal is still preserved at Worcestershire. It is a most\r\nelaborate creation, having a cedar case ornately covered with crimson\r\nvelvet and lined with yellow silk. Its weight is only twenty-four\r\npounds. Gold plate covers the front. Thirty of its fifty keys are of\r\nebony with tips of gold. The semitone keys are inlaid with silver,\r\nivory, and various woods, each key being composed of two hundred and\r\nfifty pieces. The royal arms are emblazoned upon the case. The Queen's\r\nvirginal instruction book is also carefully kept, one of the many silent\r\nrecords of the accomplishments of this gifted and brilliant woman.\r\n\r\nThe instrument which belonged, once upon a time, to Mary Queen of Scots\r\nwas not quite so gorgeous. Its case was of oak inlaid with cedar, but it\r\nwas ornamented with gold and had rare paintings on the case. It was\r\ncustomary to employ the best artists to decorate these instruments, as\r\nthis greatly enhanced their value. There is a story that Salvatore Rosa,\r\non a wager, made his almost valueless harpsichord worth a thousand scudi\r\nby painting a landscape with figures upon the lid.\r\n\r\nIn July of the year 1701 the London _Post_ had an article relating to\r\nvirginals which reads: \"This week a most curious pair of virginals,\r\nreckoned to be the finest in England, was shipped off for the Grand\r\nSeigneur's seraglio.\"\r\n\r\nOld Pepys, in his diary, gives a description of the great fire in London\r\nwhich occurred in 1666, in which he says: \"The river was full of\r\nlighters and boats, taking in goods, _good_ goods swimming in the water;\r\nand only I observed that hardly one lighter or boat but that there was a\r\npair of virginals on it.\" The word \"pair\" as it is used then had no more\r\nmeaning than when we now say \"a pair of scissors.\" This extract shows\r\nthat the instrument must have been almost as commonly used as the piano\r\nof our day. In Shakespeare's time it was customary to have a virginal in\r\na barber shop for the entertainment of customers, probably to beguile\r\nthe weary moments while they waited for the barber to say \"next.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clavichord made by John Christopher Jesse, Germany, 1765]\r\n\r\nIn shape the spinet resembled the harp placed horizontally in the\r\nframework. A very good example may be seen at the South Kensington\r\nMuseum in London. It was made by Rossi, a celebrated manufacturer. The\r\nMetropolitan Museum in New York has rare specimens of the harp which\r\nwere given by the late Mr. Drexel, of Philadelphia, who purchased them\r\nin Europe. There are two theories as to the origin of the name \"spinet.\"\r\nOne is, that it was taken from Spinetti, a Venetian who invented the\r\noblong form of the case. The other is that the strings were made to\r\nvibrate by the points of a quill, and that the word \"spinet\" came from\r\nthorn or point.\r\n\r\nIn tone the spinet was usually a fifth higher than that of the\r\nharpsichord, which came into favor during the eighteenth century. The\r\nlatter was almost exactly like our grand piano, only very much smaller.\r\nTo Italy has been accorded the honor of its origin, also, away back in\r\nthe fifteenth century. It was not commonly used, however, until about\r\n1702. A harpsichord on exhibition at the South Kensington Museum in\r\nLondon bears the date of 1521. A step towards the present-day\r\nconstruction of the piano is shown by the fact that there were always\r\ntwo wire strings to each note and sometimes three or four, and that it\r\nhad a keyboard covering five octaves. It was like an organ in that it\r\nhad register stops and sometimes a double keyboard.\r\n\r\nHans Ruckers, of Antwerp, was the most celebrated maker of the\r\nharpsichord in those days. One of his best specimens belongs to the\r\nDrexel collection in New York. Handel delighted in his Ruckers\r\nharpsichord and gave it preference over all others, which is adequate\r\nproof of its superiority. It was his pleasure to play upon it long after\r\nhis failing eyesight forbade the use of notes. He had to improvise\r\nentirely, but was so expert that the orchestra with whom he played was\r\noften diverted by his wonderful accompaniments. This partiality was\r\nresented by the soloists and one of them told Handel that if he ever\r\nplayed him such a trick while he was singing, he would jump down on his\r\nharpsichord and smash it. This amused Handel immensely and he exclaimed,\r\n\"You vill jump, vill you? Varey well, sare. Be so kind und tell me ven\r\nyou vill jump, und I vill advertise it in der bills.\" We are told that\r\nevery key of Handel's instrument was hollowed like the bowl of a spoon,\r\nso incessant was his practice. One very lovely harpsichord still in\r\nexistence has its history veiled in mystery, but the supposition is that\r\nit once belonged to Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dulcimer]\r\n\r\nClementi had one of the last harpsichords made. The date upon the case\r\nwas 1802. Beethoven's famous \"Moonlight Sonata\" was written for either\r\nharpsichord or piano. It was published in 1802. Hummel played on the\r\nharpsichord as late as 1805, but it had to give way, though most\r\nreluctantly, to the new invention called the pianoforte. Just how slow\r\nthe public was in accepting the innovation and improvement upon the\r\ninstruments mentioned, the following quotation from a folio gotten out\r\nby Thomas Mace, who was one of the clerks of Trinity College, at the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, testifies. He was pleased to call his booklet\r\n\"Musick's Monument,\" and it was printed in 1676 in London.\r\n\r\nHe scorned the new invention but warmly upheld the lute and viol. He\r\nexplained that the lute was once considered difficult to play because it\r\nhad too few strings, only ten to fourteen, while at the time of his\r\nwriting it had sixteen to twenty-six. He makes the statement that he\r\nnever spent more than a shilling a quarter for strings. The care of a\r\nlute he describes quaintly:\r\n\r\n\"And that you may know how to shelter your lute in the worst of ill\r\nweathers (which is moist) you shall do well, ever when you lay it by in\r\nthe day time, to put It into a Bed that is constantly used, between the\r\nRug and Blanket, but never between the Sheets, because, they may be\r\nmoist. This is the most absolute and best place to keep It in always, by\r\nwhich doing, you will find many Great Conveniences. Therefore, a Bed\r\nwill secure from all these inconveniences and keep your Glew as Hard as\r\nGlass and all safe and sure; only to be excepted, that no Person be so\r\ninconsiderate as to Tumble down upon the Bed whilst the lute is there,\r\nfor I have known several Good lutes spoiled with such a Trick.\"\r\n\r\nAgain we are indebted to Italy for the invention and name of the\r\npianoforte. It is a strange fact that, entirely unknown to one another,\r\nthree men were working out the same principle--namely, the hammer\r\naction--at the same time. Marius in France, Schroeter in Germany, and\r\nBartolomeo Christofori (often called Christofali) in Italy worked\r\nsecretly and simultaneously, and for a long time it was undecided to\r\nwhom the honor really belonged. A careful examination of all records,\r\nhowever, establishes beyond a doubt the priority of Christofori's\r\nclaim. The hammer action was what all previous instruments lacked, and\r\nit seems strange that it took nearly two thousand years for this\r\nprinciple to be discovered and applied. Many times the inventors\r\nappeared to be almost upon it. They worked all around it, but the idea\r\nseemed illusive and they never grasped it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Christofori Piano from the Metropolitan Museum of Art,\r\nNew York City]\r\n\r\nAt this point it might be well to enumerate in order the instruments\r\nwhich preceded the piano, if only to fasten them clearly in memory: the\r\nlyre and harp of the ancients; the dulcimer, played by means of the\r\nplectra and to which, as the hand could use but one plectrum, there was\r\na keyboard added to use all the fingers, thus moving the plectra faster;\r\nthe clavichord, with tangents of brass to strike the strings; the\r\nvirginal and the spinet, in reality the same; the harpsichord, with its\r\ncrow quills to half rub, half strike the strings, still far away from\r\nthe hammer action of the present-day piano. It seems almost\r\nunaccountable that the manufacturers who so greatly improved the\r\nmechanism of the harpsichord at this stage failed to discover the hammer\r\naction. But at last, after the quest of centuries, the quill, thorn, and\r\nivory were discarded and a small hammer struck the string, giving a\r\nclear, precise, but delicate tone hitherto unheard. The \"scratch with a\r\nsound at the end\" was gone forever. The harpsichord had been changed\r\ninto an instrument of percussion, and it only remained for man to\r\nperfect that primitive creation into the superb piano of today.\r\n\r\nAlthough Italy gave the invention to the world, it remained for northern\r\nEurope and England to take up the idea and improve it. Christofori\r\nsolved three important problems: first, the construction of thicker\r\nstrings to withstand the hammer action; second, a way to compensate for\r\nthe weakness caused by the opening in the tuning-pin block; third, the\r\nmechanical control of the rebound of the hammer from the strings, so\r\nthat the hammer should not block against the latter and prevent\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nThe first Christofori instrument was brought out in 1709. Marius did not\r\ncome forth with his claim until 1716, and Schroeter not until the next\r\nyear. The name \"pianoforte\" is traced clearly to the year 1598 and is\r\nsaid to have been originated by an Italian named Paliarino. In some of\r\nhis manuscripts he mentions an instrument called _piano e forte_. The\r\nEnglish put in a claim for a monk living in Rome who had made an\r\ninstrument resembling Christofori's in 1711 and had brought it to\r\nEngland, where it created a profound sensation. This may have been true,\r\nbut England did little to develop even the harpsichord until long after\r\nContinental makers had achieved marked success in the business. In 1760\r\nGerman workmen to the number of twelve went to London. They were known\r\nas the Twelve Apostles, and it is their descendants who became\r\nidentified with the successful development of the piano down to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nVery few of the first Christofori pianos have been preserved. One, in\r\nexcellent repair, is in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Two are in\r\nFlorence, dated 1720 and 1726. They show, beyond a doubt, that he had\r\nanticipated the plan of escapement and hammer checking. Like many other\r\npioneer inventors, this man died in comparative poverty. Schroeter, the\r\nGerman claimant, became a famous maker of instruments. He succeeded in\r\nimproving the piano to a large extent. But his life was made miserable\r\nfighting the claims of other manufacturers who sprang up and immediately\r\nwent into business. Marius met the same fate, being driven to\r\ndistraction by competitors, some of whom turned out instruments far\r\nsuperior to his.\r\n\r\nEngland did not accomplish much before the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Up to 1760 all pianos were made in what is known as the \"grand\"\r\nform. Then a German in the employ of the Tschudi's, famous makers of\r\nharpsichords, invented the familiar \"square\" style. At the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century, the most noted European makers were the Steins,\r\nStodart, Broadwood, Pleyel, Erard, and Silberman. Pleyel was\r\ndistinguished not only for his fine instruments, but for the fact that\r\nhe was the twenty-fourth child born to his mother after she married\r\nMartin Pleyel. She died soon after his birth, whereupon his father took\r\nunto himself another wife and had fourteen more children, making a\r\nfamily of thirty-eight, thirty-five of whom lived and prospered. Pleyel\r\nwas chapel master of Strasburg Cathedral. He was the author of some fine\r\nhymns and other compositions which we know and love today. He lived in\r\nParis, manufactured splendid pianos, and was, before his death,\r\nproprietor of one of the largest establishments in Europe.\r\n\r\nTo show against what prejudice the piano had to struggle as compared to\r\nthe harpsichord (and even the clavichord), we quote from a musical\r\ncritic in Leipzig who said:\r\n\r\n\"The clavichord stands highest of all instruments, and although on\r\naccount of its nature it is excluded from the concert hall, it is the\r\ncompanion of the recluse. The latter says to himself: 'Here I can\r\nproduce the feelings of my heart, can shade fully, drive away care, and\r\nmelt away a tone through all its swellings,'\" This critic says further:\r\n\r\n\"The piano is so deficient in its shadings and minor attractions, it is\r\nadapted only for concerts and chamber music.\" This dissertation closes\r\nas follows: \"In order to judge a virtuoso, one must listen to him while\r\nat the clavichord, not while at the piano or harpsichord.\"\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the novelty of the piano in the year 1767, we find on an\r\nold English play bill of the Covent Garden Theater a certain Miss\r\nBrickler advertised to sing a favorite song from \"Judith,\" accompanied\r\nby Mr. Dibdin on \"a new instrument\" called the pianoforte. This was at\r\nthe intermission after the first act of \"The Beggars\" opera.\r\n\r\nAfter Mozart became acquainted with the piano, he gave his preference to\r\nthose made by Stein, of Augsburg. Afterwards, however, he transferred\r\nhis affection to those made by Anton Walter, of Vienna. His \"grand,\"\r\nwhich was but five octaves, with white sharps and black naturals, is now\r\nin the Mozarteum at Salzburg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Piano made by Matth\u00e4us Andreas Stein\r\nVienna, early Nineteenth Century]\r\n\r\nSilberman, the German maker, was finally successful in interesting King\r\nFrederick of Prussia in his new instrument to the extent of persuading\r\nhim to purchase outright all he had finished. There were some\r\nfifteen of these, which were placed in the rooms at the palace. This\r\ndemonstrates the King's love for music. He was a flute player of\r\nconsiderable ability. One of the court musicians was Carl Philip Emanuel\r\nBach, son of the great master, and King Frederick had expressed a desire\r\nto hear the elder Bach play upon the new invention. For some time old\r\nSebastian was obstinate and tartly declined all invitations. His son at\r\nlast cajoled him into acceding to the King's wishes. He arrived most\r\nunexpectedly and excited the King to such an extent that he rushed out\r\nexclaiming: \"Gentlemen, old Bach has come.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the performance he stood behind the musician's chair muttering in\r\nan undertone: \"Only one Bach, only one Bach.\" The King requested the\r\nimprovisation of a fugue in six parts, which the master did to the\r\nastonishment of all present. But for the new instrument Bach had little\r\nuse. He complimented Silberman on his production, but he found fault\r\nwith the unequal tones. He said the high notes were too weak, that it\r\nwas too hard to play. Of course this greatly displeased the maker. For a\r\nlong time he was very angry. But his better judgment came to the rescue\r\nand at a later date he succeeded in producing an instrument to which the\r\nmaster gave his approval. Bach, however, was never convinced that any\r\ninstrument was equal to his beloved clavichord.\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to women to know that Maria Anna Stein,\r\ndaughter of Johann Andreas Stein, the piano maker, was a most\r\nsuccessful business woman, carrying on the manufacturing of instruments.\r\nThis she continued after her marriage to Herr Streicher. She was a\r\nperson of rare refinement and a warm friend of Beethoven, whom she\r\ngreatly admired. She was privileged to make his last years more\r\ncomfortable than any he had previously experienced. Good servants were\r\nprovided to look after his bodily needs and she always had one of her\r\nbest pianos at his disposal. In a letter to \"Nanette,\" as she was\r\ncalled, he wrote: \"Perhaps you do not know that though I have not always\r\nhad one of your pianos, since 1809 I have invariably preferred them.\"\r\n\r\nAs late as 1882 there was a grand piano at Windsor Castle which bore\r\nthe name of Nanette Stein, Maker. It belonged to Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nClementi may be considered the first legitimate writer for the piano.\r\nAll the great masters, including Scarlatti, Handel, Bach, and Haydn (in\r\nhis first compositions), were written for the clavichord. So when\r\nlistening to the classics they have left for us, we must remember the\r\nlimitations of the instruments upon which they played and for which they\r\nwrote. Probably no one has realized this fact more keenly than the late\r\nMr. Morris Steinert, of New Haven, Conn. He spent the best years of his\r\nlife (to say nothing of his fortune) in collecting the rare and valuable\r\ninstruments which he presented to Yale College.\r\n\r\nMr. Steinert not only searched for these treasures all over Europe, but\r\nhe had them restored and played upon them, thus giving to the world the\r\nlong-forgotten sounds and showing, by the only method possible, just how\r\nthe great masters played. During the World's Fair the Steinert\r\ncollection was in the Manufacturers' Building, the center of attraction\r\nfor music lovers. His experiences were most interesting in obtaining\r\nsome of the rarest specimens. For instance, a harpsichord with the date\r\n1710 on its case was found broken and dust-covered in an attic in\r\nVienna. It had two keyboards, tortoise-shell naturals and ivory sharps.\r\nIt had eight stops, one imitating the lute and one the flute. The\r\nsounding board was elaborately painted with flowers and other\r\ndecorative symbols, while the inside lid was ornate with strictly\r\nJapanese art.\r\n\r\nThe dearly loved \"Nanette Stein\" piano, Beethoven's much prized\r\npossession, is in Mr. Steinert's collection. America is the home of many\r\npriceless pianos. In this same group we find an instrument once\r\nbelonging to Napoleon Bonaparte. To be correct, it is a harpsichord, and\r\nit was given to a French sergeant when the fallen monarch was banished\r\nto St. Helena. The Frenchman came to America and gave the harpsichord to\r\nSimon Bates, of Scituate Harbor Light, Mass., from whose heirs Mr.\r\nSteinert purchased it. Claviers, dulcimers, spinets, and harpsichords,\r\nbelonging once upon a time to Bach, Haydn, and Mozart, are in this\r\nfamous collection.\r\n\r\nBesides the instruments of bygone days, Mr. Steinert has been able to\r\nget original manuscripts, worth their weight in gold. It is a\r\nfascinating character study to examine the scores of the old masters and\r\nnote the difference in style and method. For many years this man made\r\narduous tours with his instruments, giving lectures and illustrating\r\nthem with actual performance of the music on the instrument for which it\r\nwas composed. His only compensation was that he felt he was furthering\r\nthe true spirit of art and music in this the country of his adoption. In\r\nhis personal reminiscences published some years ago he says:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Piano made by Benjamin Crehore, Boston Cir. 1800]\r\n\r\n\"How dealers in pianos of this day must envy the manufacturers of the\r\ngood old times when they remember that then the would-be purchaser had\r\nto look up the maker and court his pleasure. He had to sign a written\r\ncontract, the terms of which sound droll enough to us. The time limit\r\nfor construction was from six to twelve months and the payments were,\r\ngenerally, so much cash, so many casks of wine, a certain amount of\r\ncorn, wheat, and potatoes, while geese, chickens, and turkeys\r\nconstituted some of the articles used in payment. Even a few cords of\r\nwood would be acceptable in making up the balance. When the piano was\r\ncompleted, ready for delivery at the home of the impatient purchaser, a\r\ngeneral festival took place. The maker was the hero of the hour. He\r\nwas accompanied by his craftsmen, and apprentices if he had any, and\r\nthey followed the gaily decorated wagon and horses which bore the\r\nprecious burden to its new home. A band of music headed the procession\r\nand the maker was borne aloft on the shoulders of his assistants.\r\nMusicians, organists, school masters, and other dignitaries marched in\r\nthe rear. At the place of destination the procession was received with\r\njoyous shouts of welcome. The minister said a prayer and blessed the\r\ninstrument and its maker. Then the mayor or burgomaster delivered an\r\naddress, dwelling at length upon the importance of the event to the\r\nwhole community, stating that the coming of the new musical instrument\r\nwould raise the standing of the place in the eyes of the surrounding\r\ncountryside. Speeches followed by the school master, doctor, druggist,\r\nand other officials. The mannechor of the village rendered songs, and\r\namid the strains from the band the piano was moved into place. A banquet\r\nand dance closed the happy occasion.\"\r\n\r\nIn those days the manufacturer had to make each article by hand that\r\nwent into a piano, which is the reason it took so long to finish the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Piano made by Charles Albrecht, Philadelphia]\r\n\r\nIf the early records are reliable, the history of the piano in this\r\ncountry begins at Philadelphia. In 1775 John Behrend, a German or Swede,\r\nbuilt an instrument in the Quaker city, and up to 1855 it continued to\r\nbe the center of trade in musical instruments. When we consider how\r\nmuch the piano has contributed to the happiness of mankind and to the\r\npromotion of art and culture, the honor conceded to the Pennsylvania\r\ncity is by no means a small one. The first spinets and virginals made on\r\nthis side of the water were undoubtedly of Philadelphia manufacture.\r\nThis was in the year 1742. Along with its musical progress it is said\r\nthat the first hand or barrel organs were made there, and of the latter\r\nsome one says: \"They are the curse and plague of the modern high class\r\nindividual.\" A Scotchman, who settled in Philadelphia near the end of\r\n1785, was the maker of the hand-organ.\r\n\r\nTo show that the town was progressive in all kinds of instruments, we\r\nfind that the historical society of Philadelphia has records of the\r\nfirst organ built there in 1737 by one Mathew Zimmerman. Local\r\nhistorians claim it to be the first one built in America. John Clark\r\nbuilt one at Salem, Mass., in 1743, for the Episcopal church at that\r\nplace. This puts Massachusetts well to the front in early musical\r\nhistory. Zimmerman's will, probated the same year he finished the organ,\r\nbequeaths it to his nephew and expresses the hope that he would learn to\r\nplay upon it, adding, \"If not, it can be sold, owing to its being so\r\nmuch of a curiosity.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Piano, Primitive German Action. Eighteenth Century]\r\n\r\nThe story of the first piano to come into this country is truly romantic\r\nand historic. The famous continental frigate \"Boston,\" a\r\nprivateer, sailed into port with a British merchant ship as a prize. The\r\ndauntless Captain Tucker was in command. The cargo was sold for the\r\nbenefit of the National Treasury, and among other articles was a\r\npianoforte of London make.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the revolutionary period that the spinet and\r\nharpsichord were superseded in this country by the piano. A newspaper of\r\n1791 tells us that there were some twenty-seven pianos among the wealthy\r\nBoston families. All were of English make. In 1840 slow, easy-going ways\r\ncrept into Philadelphia and she lost the prestige she once enjoyed of\r\nbeing the center of musical culture as well as of art and literature.\r\nBoston took the place and has held it ever since. Many of the\r\ndistinctive features of the American piano actually originated there,\r\nsuch as the applying of metal in construction, which idea was first\r\nshown to be practical by Alpheus Babcock and Jonas Chickering. Then\r\nTimothy Gilbert, another Boston man, conceived the upright action which\r\nis in such general use today. There is no doubt but that Chickering was\r\nthe first man who dared deviate from a prescribed method in case\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nOld newspapers contain much of interest concerning these first days in\r\nthe musical history of our country. In the Boston _Gazette_, published\r\nin 1770, we are told that an excellent spinet had just been completed\r\nwhich for goodness of workmanship and harmony of sound was esteemed by\r\nthe best judges to be superior to those imported. So much for American\r\nskill and enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt might be well to mention that Massachusetts is credited with making\r\nthe first violins in this country. In 1789, also, there were two\r\nteachers of harp and piano in Boston, one of whom could act as tuner and\r\nrepairer if occasion demanded. We find that Boston early supported a\r\nmusical magazine. In 1797 Peter Van Hazen left New York for the \"Hub\"\r\nand there issued the first copy of his publication devoted to topics on\r\nmusic. He also imported sheet music direct from London. It was about\r\n1800 when Benjamin Crehore, of Milton, Mass., built the first piano\r\never made in this country, and he did it in Boston. He was a skilled\r\nworkman who knew how to make violins, 'cellos, guitars, drums, and\r\nflutes. Ten or twelve pianos were all he could make in one year and, to\r\nthe shame of America be it recorded, he had to put the stamp of _London_\r\nor _Paris_ upon them before he could make a sale, showing that our\r\nforefathers considered the foreign made article superior to those of\r\nhome manufacture. All these things are changed, however; the American\r\ninstrument now commands the highest price and is shipped to every part\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Stodart Piano (Old English)]\r\n\r\nThe New York newspapers of olden time contain many notices that are\r\ncurious enough to us who read them over in this day and generation.\r\nFor instance, we find that \"Peter Goelet has just gotten in a supply of\r\ngoods on the ship 'Earl of Dunmore,' and advertises that he has over\r\nthree hundred articles, from masons' trowels to oil paint, skillets and\r\nbooks, paint-pots, guitars, fiddles, flutes and other musical\r\ninstruments, as well as a large box of harpsichord wire and hammers.\"\r\n\r\nThis motley collection no doubt found eager customers. Another paper\r\ntells us that \"Herman Zedwitz, teacher of the violin, announces to the\r\npublic that he has just returned from Europe and will give a concert in\r\nthe assembly rooms at the 'Sign of the Golden Spade.'\" Later, in 1774,\r\nthis same man evidently found that the public did not appreciate him\r\nmusically, for the intervals were so long between lessons and\r\nengagements for his violin that he was forced to take up the occupation\r\nof a chimney sweep. From accounts in the paper he must have inaugurated\r\na sort of trust, for he advertised to take contracts by the year for\r\n\"dusting out the sooty interior of flues\" and adds, \"None but competent\r\nboys employed.\" Evidently musical culture in New York was temporarily at\r\na low ebb.\r\n\r\nIn this story of the evolution of the piano we have seen how, from its\r\nprimitive beginning, it has become the one splendid instrument that is\r\ncapable of representing the effect of a full orchestra. Before the death\r\nof Beethoven he realized the tremendous power of the piano and\r\ndisplayed its resources in a manner undreamed of by Haydn. Could these\r\nold masters return today and sit at one of the splendid productions of\r\nthe twentieth century they would be dumb with amazement and entirely at\r\na loss as to how to handle the enormous range of seven and a third\r\noctaves. Best of all, the price is such that some style of modern piano\r\nis within the reach of nearly every one. Music in the home is now the\r\nrule, not the exception.\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt has well expressed the feeling of all piano lovers in these\r\nverses, which are full of sentiment:\r\n\r\n    Oh, friend, whom glad or gay we seek,\r\n        Heaven-holding shrine;\r\n    I ope thee, touch thee, hear thee speak,\r\n        And peace is mine.\r\n    No fairy casket full of bliss,\r\n        Outvalues thee;\r\n    Love only, wakened with a kiss\r\n        More sweet may be.\r\n\r\n    To thee, when our full hearts o'erflow,\r\n        In griefs or joys\r\n    Unspeakable, emotions owe\r\n        A fitting voice.\r\n    Mirth flees to thee, and loves unrest,\r\n        And memory dear,\r\n    And sorrow, with his tightened breast\r\n        Comes for a tear.\r\n\r\n    Oh, since few joys of human mould,\r\n        Thus wait us still,\r\n    Thrice blessed be thine, thou gentle fold\r\n        Of peace at will.\r\n    No change, no sullenness, no cheat\r\n        In thee we find;\r\n    Thy saddest voice is ever sweet,\r\n        Thine answer kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Transcriber's Note:\r\n\r\n   The following typographical errors have been corrected:\r\n\r\n   \"Stien,\" \"Stiens,\" and \"Stienert\" have been changed to \"Stein,\"\r\n   \"Steins,\" and \"Steinert\" in a number of places throughout the text.\r\n\r\n   The incorrect page number in the list of illustrations for the Charles\r\n   Albrecht piano illustration has been changed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's How the Piano Came to Be, by Ellye Howell Glover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOW THE PIANO CAME TO BE ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
