    <h2>Why This Role Interests Me</h2>
    <p>
        The role of Backend Engineer at Similarweb is appealing because of its emphasis on web scraping and data extraction, which are key areas that interest me. I have a passion for automated data collection, and I love the challenges that come with extracting valuable insights from online sources. Similarweb’s impact on empowering industry giants with digital intelligence is something I find inspiring, and I want to contribute to an organization at the forefront of digital transformation. The opportunity to work in Zurich and collaborate with a talented team from across the globe also aligns with my goal of expanding my international experience and knowledge-sharing.
    </p>

    <h2>My Relevant Skills and Competencies</h2>
    <p>
        I bring over 2.5 years of experience as a backend web developer, during which I gained expertise in designing and maintaining complex systems. In my current job, I work with technologies like Docker and PHP, providing me with DevOps capabilities and experience in containerization—skills which are also required for this role. While my main work experience has been with PHP, I have hands-on experience with Java, which I used in several projects during my studies. Additionally, I have expiriance in NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB, which I utilized in academic projects. My ongoing web scraping project, scraping product information from Migros to detect price changes has equipped me with a good foundation in data extraction and management, directly matching the core responsibilities of this role.

    <p>
        At Similarweb, I aim to contribute my technical experiance in programing and backend development to help improve the company’s data colection tools. I am enthusiastic about joining a company that values curiosity, innovation, and practical problem-solving, and I look forward to contributing to impactful projects. I also believe that my background in backend development and passion for building reliable, scalable data pipelines can help Similarweb maintain and improve its top-tier digital intelligence solutions. Ultimately, I hope to make a meaningful impact by working closely with the R&D team, using my skills to overcome challenges and continuously improve Similarweb’s offerings.
