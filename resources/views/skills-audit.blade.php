        <p>
            Completing the CareerSmart Skills Audit gave me valuable insights into areas that I most want to focus on
            for my professional growth. For this audit i did mostly focus on non tecnicall subjects becaue i belive i
            currently already put a big jonk of my focus toward this, at work in school and in personal Below, I reflect
            on the key skills identified in the audit, and my action plan for improvement.
        </p>

        <h2>Influence and Persuasion</h2>
        <p>
            One of the key skills identified for improvement is "Influence and Persuasion". This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Convincing others to see my point of view</li>
            <li>Using positive body language to influence others</li>
            <li>Not being defensive when others don’t agree</li>
            <li>Negotiating a win-win result</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Being able to influence and persuade others is valuable, particularly when working in interdisciplinary
            teams where viewpoints may differ. I plan to work on improving my persuasive skills while remaining open to
            differing opinions. This will involve practicing <a
                href="https://careersmart.org.uk/resources/negotiation-skills"
                target="_blank"
            >negotiation skills</a> and focusing on non-verbal cues such as body language.
        </p>

        <h2>Managing Others</h2>
        <p>
            Another skill area I identified as one i'd like to improve is managing others. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrating effective leadership</li>
            <li>Managing the performance of others</li>
            <li>Building a team</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Leadership is a critical skill, especially as I envision myself growing into roles that require taking on
            more responsibility. To address this, I plan to work on learning how to effectively guide team members and
            help them succeed. I intend to practice these skills by taking on leadership roles in group projects, by
            learning from resources like the <a
                href="https://careersmart.org.uk/your-career"
                target="_blank"
            >"Your Career" section on CareerSmart</a> and other leadership articles.
        </p>

        <h2>Communication Skills</h2>
        <p>
            Communication emerged as another area that I want to develop further. It involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Actively listening</li>
            <li>Handling interpersonal conflicts</li>
            <li>Delivering business presentations</li>
            <li>Communicating assertively</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Strong communication is crucial, not only for conveying my ideas but also for fostering collaboration. I aim
            to improve my listening skills and to better manage conflicts, ensuring effective and respectful
            interactions with others. Practicing business presentations and developing assertiveness will also be part
            of my plan, and I will be exploring tools like <a
                href="https://careersmart.org.uk/resources/workshops"
                target="_blank"
            >workshops</a> and <a
                href="https://careersmart.org.uk/resources/online-courses"
                target="_blank"
            >online courses</a> to help in this area.
        </p>

        <h2>Team Working</h2>
        <p>
            Working effectively as part of a team is something I want to enhance, because i belive one can benefit from
            improving this skill in all stages, especially in terms of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Working collaboratively</li>
            <li>Motivating others</li>
            <li>Allowing others to take the lead</li>
            <li>Coordinating my work with others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Teamwork is at the core of almost every professional setting. I recognize that it’s important not only to
            collaborate effectively but also to encourage others, support team goals, and know when to step back to let
            others lead. I plan to actively seek out opportunities to be a supportive team member and to develop my
            coordination skills by working on <a
                href="https://careersmart.org.uk/resources/group-projects"
                target="_blank"
            >collaborative projects</a> and reflecting on my contributions.
        </p>

        <h2>Action Plan for Improvement</h2>
        <p>
            Based on this skills audit, I have outlined the following steps to improve:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Take Leadership Courses</strong>: Explore <a
                    href="https://careersmart.org.uk/resources/leadership-courses"
                    target="_blank"
                >online courses focused on leadership</a>, as well as books and articles that guide effective management
                practices.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Practice Communication</strong>: Engage more in group discussions, deliver presentations in
                class, and work on assertive communication techniques.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Work on Team Projects</strong>: Volunteer for <a
                    href="https://careersmart.org.uk/resources/team-projects"
                    target="_blank"
                >team projects</a>, both academic and extracurricular, to actively practice teamwork and motivational
                skills.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Learn Influence Techniques</strong>: Practice <a
                    href="https://careersmart.org.uk/resources/negotiation-and-influence"

                >negotiation skills through role-playing exercises</a>, and observe effective communicators for tips on
                persuasive body language.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This reflection has given me a clear picture of where I stand, and it’s motivating me to take actionable
            steps toward becoming a more well-rounded professional. Growth requires consistent effort, and I am ready to
            put in the work.
